You are required to send software application code, database, and any other
important file
For this purpose compress all files (zip or rar) and email
to your project supervisor.

Some times Gmail will return the email saying the email contains
illegal attachment. This can be fixed by renaming the file extension
to something not very common. Such as when compressing the file
you should not set it as FileName.rar or FileName.zip
instead you can use: FileName.abc
etc

This way your attachment can be sent without any problem, and the supervisor
can rename .abc back to .rar or .zip to get original file.
